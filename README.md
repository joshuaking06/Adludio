# Adludio tasks



### Task 1 - Screenshot of my completed front end, in case on larger screens my sizing is different
I initially set up for task 1 using react, but instead removed it and used barebones html/css as I didn't think it was necessary for just a simple static page like this. I also did not use any frameworks though did consider it to make the form look exactly the same.

### Task 2, to run server simply run command node index.js in terminal
